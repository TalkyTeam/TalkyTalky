                "transcript": "Chapter five of The Call of the Wild. This labor box recording is in the public domain and is read by Mark Smith of Simpsonville, South Carolina. The Call of the Wild by Jack London. Chapter five The Toil of Trace and Trail 30 days From the time it left, Dawson, the saltwater male with Buck and his mates at the four arrived at Skagway. They were in a wretched state, worn out and worn down bucks. £140 had dwindled to 115. The rest of his mates, though lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike. The malingerer who in his lifetime of deceit had often successfully feigned a hurt leg, was now limping and earnest. Selects was limping, and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder blade. They were all terribly foot sore. No spring or rebound was left in them. Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day's travel. There was nothing the matter with them, except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a matter of hours, but it was the dead tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had all been used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fiber. Every cell was tired, dead tired, and there was reason for it. In less than five months, they had traveled 2500 miles during the last 1800 of which they had but five days rest. When they arrived at Skagway, they were apparently on their last legs. They could barely keep the traces taught and on the downgrades, just managed to keep out of the way of the sled mush on poor sore feats. The driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of Scag way Dis is Dallas. Did we get one? Long rest, say for sure. One bully. Long rest. The drivers confidently expected a long stopover themselves. They had covered 1200 miles with two days rest, and in the nature of reason and common justice, they deserved an interval of loafing. But so many were the men who had rushed into the Clon Dyke. And so many were the sweethearts, wives and kin that had not rushed in that the congested male was taking on Alpine proportions. Also, there were official orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be got rid off. And since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold three days passed by which time Buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two men from the States came along and bought them harness and all for a song. The men addressed each other is Hal and Charles. Charles was a middle aged, light ish colored man with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed. How was a youngster of 19 or 20 with a big cults revolver and a hunting knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges? This belt was the most salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness, Ah, callowness, sheer and unutterable, both men were manifestly out of place, and why such as they should adventure The North is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding. Buck heard the chattering, saw the money passed between the man and the government agent and knew that the Scotch half breed and the mail train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Peralta and Francois and the others who had gone before when driven with his mates to the new owners, Camp Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair tent half stretched dishes, unwashed everything in disorder. Also, he saw a woman Mercedes. The men called her. She was Charles's wife and howls sister, a nice family party. Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their manner, but no business like method. The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were packed away. Unwashed Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up on unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice when they put a close sack on the front of the sled. She suggested it should go on the back, and when they had put it on the back and covered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered overlooked articles, which could abide nowhere else. But in that very sack and the unloaded again, three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and winking at one another. You've got a right smart load as it is, said one of them. And it's not me should tell you your business, but I wouldnt tote that tender log if I was you undreamed off, cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands and dainty dismay. However, in the world could I manage without a tent? It's springtime and you won't get any more cold weather, the man replied. She shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and ends on top of the mountainous load. Think it'll ride? One of the men asked. Why shouldn't it? Charles demanded, rather shortly. Oh, that's all right. That's all right, the man hastened meekly to say. I was just wondering that is all it seemed to my top heavy. Charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could, which was not in the least well. And, of course, the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them. Affirmed. A second of the men certainly, said Hal with freezing politeness, taking hold of the G poll with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. Mush, he shouted. Mush! On there! The dog sprang against the breast bands strained hard for a few moments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled. The lazy brutes. I'll show them, he cried, preparing to lash out at them with the whip. But Mercedes interfered, crying, Oh, hell, you mustn't. As she caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him, The poor dears. Now, you must promise you won't be harsh with them for the rest of the trip. Or I won't go a step precious lot. You know about dogs? Her brother sneered, and I wish you'd leave me alone. They're lazy, I tell you, and you've got to whip them to get anything out of them. That's their way. You ask anyone? Ask one of those men. Mercedes looked at them imploring Lee untold repugnance at site of pain written in her pretty face. Their week is water. If you want to know, came to reply from one of the men plumb tuckered out. That's what's the matter. They need a rest. Rest be blanked, said Hal, with his beardless lips. And Mercedes said, Oh, in pain and sorrow at the oath. But she was a clannish creature and rushed. It wants to the defense of her brother. Never mind that man, she said pointedly. You're driving our dogs and you do what you think best with them again. Hal's whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the breast bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it and put forth all their strength. The sled held is though it were an anchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was whistling savagely when once more Mercedes interfered, she dropped on her knees before buck with tears in her eyes and put her arms around his neck. You poor, poor tears, she cried sympathetically. Why don't you pull hard? Then you wouldn't be whipped. Buck did not like her, but he was feeling too miserable to resist her taking. It is part of the day's miserable work. One of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech now spoke up. It's not that I care. Ah, whoop what becomes of you. But for the dogs sake, I just want to tell you you can help them. A mighty lop eye breaking out that sled, the runners air froze fast. Throw your weight against the G poll right and left and break it out. Ah, third time the attempt was made. But this time, following the advice, how broke out the runners, which had been frozen to the snow, the overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows. Ah, 100 yards ahead, the path turned and slope steeply into the main street. It would have required an experienced man to keep the top heavy sled upright, and Hal was not such a man. As they swung on the turn, the sled went over, spilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never stopped. The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load buck was raging. He broke into a run. The team following his lead, Hal cried. Whoa, whoa! But they gave no heed. He tripped and was pulled off his feet. The capsized sled ground over him and the dogs dashed on up the street, adding to the gaity of SCAG way. As they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare, kind hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings. Also, they gave advice half the load and twice the dogs, if they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and his sister and brother in law listened unwillingly, pitched tent and overhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men laugh for canned goods. On the long trail is a thing to dream about. Blankets for a hotel, quoth one of the men who laughed and helped half assed Many is too much. Get rid of them. Throw away that tent and all those dishes. Who's gonna wash them anyway? Good Lord, do you think you're traveling on a Pullman? And so it went. The inexorable elimination of the superfluous Mercedes cried when her clothes. Bags were dumped on the ground, and article after article was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in particular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about, knees rocking back and forth. Broken heartedly, she averred. She would not go on inch, not for a dozen. Charles is. She appealed to everybody and everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal, when she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado. This accomplished the outfit, though cut in half, was still a formidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six outside dogs. These added to the six of the original team, antique and kuna the Huskies obtained at the rink. Rapids on the record trip, brought the team up to 14. But the outside dogs, though practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. Three were short haired pointers. One was a Newfoundland, and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know anything. These newcomers Buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust, and though we speedily taught them their places and what not to dio, he could not teach them what to dio. They did not take kindly to trace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were bewildered and spirit broken by the strange, savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The two mongrels were without spirit at all. Bones were the only things breakable about them. With the newcomers hopeless and forlorn and the old team worn out by 2500 miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything but bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful, and they were proud to they were doing the thing in style with 14 dogs. They had seen other sleds to part over the past for Dawson or come in from Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as 14 dogs. In the nature of Arctic travel, there was a reason why 14 dogs should not drag one sled, and that was that. One sled could not carry the food for 14 dogs, but Charleston, Hell did not know this. They had worked the trip out with a pencil. So much to a dog, so many dogs so many days, Q. E d Mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively. It was all so very simple. Late next morning, Buck led the long team up the street. There was nothing lively about it. No snap or go in him and his fellows, they were starting dead, weary. Four times he had covered the distance between saltwater and Dawson, and the knowledge that jaded and tired he was facing the same trail once more made him bitter. His heart was not in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The outsides were timid and frightened the insides without confidence in their masters, Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman. They did not know how to do anything. And as the days went by, it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all things, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp and half the morning to break that camp and get that sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they did not make 10 miles. On other days, they were unable to get started at all and on no dated. They succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their dog food computation. It was inevitable that they should go short on dog food, but they hastened it by overfeeding bringing the day nearer when, under feeding would commence. The outside dogs, whose digestion has not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little had voracious appetites. And when, in addition to this, the worn out huskies pulled weekly, Hal decided that the Orthodox ration was too small. He doubled it. And to cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quiver in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dog still mawr, she stole from the fish sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food that Buck and the Huskies needed but rest. And though they were making poor time the heavy load they dragged sap their strength severely. Then came the under feeding. Hala woke one day to the fact that his dog food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered further that for love or money. No additional dog food was to be obtained, so he cut down even the Orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's travel. His sister and brother in law seconded him, but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a simple matter to give the dogs less food, but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get underway earlier in the morning prevented them from traveling longer hours, not only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how toe work themselves. The first to go was dub poor, blundering thief that he waas always getting caught and punished. He had nonetheless been a faithful worker, his rent shoulder blade untreated and unrest id went from bad to worse. Till finally, how shot him with the big colts revolver. It is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the ration of the Husky, So the six outside, dogs under Buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the Husky. The Newfoundland went first, followed by the three short haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging Mawr, Gridley onto life. But going in the end. By this time, all the amenities and gentleness is of the Southland had fallen away from the three people shorn of its glamour and romance. Arctic travel became to them, a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs. Being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarreling with her husband and brother to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to dio. They're irritability, arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled upon it. Outdistance did the wonderful patience of the trail, which comes to men who toil hard and suffers sore and remains sweet of speech and kindly did not come to these two men and the woman. They had no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain. Their muscles ache, their bones ache, their very hearts ache. And because of this they became sharp of speech and hard words were first on their lips in the morning, and last night, Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work and neither four board to speak this belief at every opportunity. Sometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother. The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel, starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire on dispute, which concerned only Charles and Hal presently would be lugged in the rest of the family. Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands of miles away and some of them dead, that house views on art or the sort of society plays his mother's brother wrote, should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood passes comprehension. Nevertheless, the quarrel was ASL likely to tend in that direction, as in the direction of Charles's political prejudices, and that Charles's sisters tale bearing tongue should be relevant to the building of a Yukon Fire was apparent. Only two Mercedes who disburse didn't herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally, upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband's family. In the meantime, the fire remained unbuilt. The camp half pitched on the dogs. Unf ed Mercedes nursed a special grievance. The Grievance of sex. She was pretty and soft and habit chivalrous. Lee treated all her days. But the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex prerogative. She made their lives unendurable. She no longer considered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted in riding on the sled. She was pretty and soft, but she weighed £120. Ah, lusty last draw to the load, dragged by the week and starving animals, she rowed for days till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still. Charleston, Hal begged her to get off and walk, pleaded with her entreated. The while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of their brutality. On one occasion, they took her off the sled. By main strength, they never did it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child and sat down on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After they had traveled three miles, they unloaded the sled, came back for her and, by main strength, put her on the sled again in the excess of their own misery. They were callous to the suffering of their animals. Houses theory, which he practiced on others was that one must get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and brother in law, failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a club at the five fingers, the dog food gave out, and a toothless old schooI offered to trade them. A few pounds of frozen horse hide for the Colts revolver that kept the big hunting knife company. It houses hip. Ah, poor substitute for food. Was this hide, just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattleman? Six months back in his frozen state, it was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog wrestled it into a stomach, it thought into thin and in nutritious, leathery strings and into a mass of short hair, irritating and indigestible, and through it all bucks staggered along at the head of the team, as in a nightmare he pulled when he could. When he could no longer pull, he fell down and remain down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and drag Aled or matted with dried blood work houses Club. It bruised him. His muscles had wasted away to naughty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was heartbreaking. Onley bucks Heart was unbreakable. The man in the red sweater had proved that as it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulations skeletons. There were seven altogether, including him, and they're very great misery. They have become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant. Justus, the things their eyes saw and their ears heard, seemed dull and distant. They were not half living or quarter living. There were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly when a halt was made. They dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and this sparked dimmed, impaled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to their feet and staggered on. There came a day when Billy the good Natured fell and could not rise. Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the ax and knocked Billy on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw and his mates saw, and they knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day, Kuno went and but five of them remained. Joe, too far gone to be malignant pike, crippled and limping on Lee, half conscious and not conscious enough longer to malingerer. So Lex, the one I'd still faithful to the toil of trace and trail and mournful in that he had so little strength with which to pool teak who had not traveled so far that winter, and it was now beaten mawr than the others because he was fresher and buck still it the head of the team but no longer enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet. It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all the land fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that lived and moved again. Things which had been is dead and which had not moved. During the long months of frost, the sap was rising in the pines. The willows and the aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh carbs of green crickets sang in the nights and in the days, all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering birds, singing and overhead hawk, the wildfowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air. From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away from beneath the sun, eight from above, air holes formed. Fishers sprang and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river. And amid all this bursting, rending throbbing of awakening life under the blazing sun and through the soft, sighing breezes like wayfarers to death staggered the two men, the woman and the Huskies, with the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and writing Hal swearing innocuously and Charles's eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into John Thornton's camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log to rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly one of his great stiffness. How did the talking John Thornton was whittling the last touches on an ax handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and when it was asked terse advice, he knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed. They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was toe lay over, Hal said in response to Thornton's warning. To take no more chances on the Rotten Nice. They told us we couldn't make White River. And here we are, this last with a sneering ring of triumph in it. And they told you True, John Thornton answered the bottoms likely to drop out at any moment on Lee Fools with the blind luck of fools could have made it. I tell you straight I wouldn't risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in Alaska. That's because you're not a fool, I suppose, said Hal. All the same, we'll go onto Dawson, he uncoiled his whip. Get up there buck high. Get up mush on, Thornton went on whittling. It was idle. He knew to get between a fool and his folly, while two or three fools, more or less would not alter the scheme of things. But the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed out here and there on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed his lips. Selects, was the first to crawl to his feet. Teak followed. Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts Twice. He fell over when half up and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck made no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into him again and again, but he neither wind nor struggled Several times. Thornton started as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture came into his eyes, and as the whipping continued, he arose and walked irresolute. Lee, up and down. This was the first time Bucket failed in itself, a sufficient reason to Dr Howell into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club. Buck refused to move under the reign of heavier blows, which now fell upon him. Like his mates, he barely able to get up. But unlike them, he had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of impending doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled into the bank, and it did not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten nice he had felt under his feet all day? It seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand out there, ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him. He refused to star. So greatly had he suffered. And so far gone was he that the blows did not hurt much, and as they continued to fall upon him, the spark of life within flickered and went down. It was nearly out. He felt strangely numb, as though from a great distance he was aware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of pain left him. He no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body, but it was no longer his body. It seemed so far away and then, suddenly without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness. John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, to convulsed with rage to speak. If you strike that dog again, how kill you? He had last managed to say in a choking voice. It's my dog, Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. Get out of my way or I'll fix you. I'm going to Dawson. Thornton stood between him and buck and events. No intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting knife. Mercedes scream, cried, laughed and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton wrapped house knuckles with the ax handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself and, with two strokes, cut bucks traces. Hal had no fight left in him Besides, his hands were full with his sister or his arms. Rather, while Buck was too near dead to be a further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later, they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see Pike was leading. Selects was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teak. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the G pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear. As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him in with rough, kindly hands search for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it, crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back and dropped down as into a rut. And the G poll with how clinging to it jerk into the air. Mercedes scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way, and dogs and humans disappear. Ah, yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail. John Thornton and Buck looked at each other. You poor devil, said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand end of Chapter five."
