TalkyTalky is a group of Python scripts used to align the text version of a book with the transcript of an audio book, for the purpose of creating an EPUB3 "talking book".

TalkyTalky uses Project Gutenberg for EPUB3 source books and Librivox for spoken books.  The test transcripts and timings were generated by [AWS Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/).
